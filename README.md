# leaflet-challenge
Module 15 Challenge
Leaflet part one is complete. I was able to get this done using geojson file with help from chatGPT and previous assignments to set the structure of my js file.
I did not attempt leaflet part two. I was told before I started that it was behind a paywall and didn't even attempt.
